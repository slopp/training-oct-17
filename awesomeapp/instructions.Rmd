First we need to setup the  `shinytest` package and a tool called `phantomJS`:

```{r setup]}
library(shinytest)
webdriver::install_phantomjs()
```

To run a test,  use:

```{r recordtest}
recordTest()
```

The result is a `tests` folder:

```{bash}
tree .
```

The recorder captured your actions against the application in the test file:

```{bash}
cat tests/mytest.R
```

The recorder also captured the expected results for those actions:

```{bash}
cat tests/mytest-expected/001.json
```

To run the app against the test, use:

```{r runtest}
testApp()
```

## Exercises

1. Change the application code (somnething minor like updating the title field.) Run `testApp()` again. What happens?


2. Modify the test file `tests/mytest.R` so that the test updates the `type` dropdown to `unempl`. What does the test do now?

**Hint**:

```
app <- ShinyDriver$new("../")
app$snapshotInit("mytest")

app$setInputs(type = "unempl")
app$snapshot()
app$setInputs(smoother = TRUE)
app$setInputs(f = 0.24)
```

3. Re-record a test, but use the snapshot button more than once. What is different in the `tests` file?
